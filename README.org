* zenfinger

A server for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(protocol)][the finger protocol]].

The name comes from the myth of Shaolin Kungfu. It was said that there's a kind of Kungfu called the "One Finger Zen" where you train your index fingers to the point of being able to do push-ups on them, and after that your fingers would be very powerful. Of course a myth is just a myth and I doubt index fingers could even get half as powerful as people have been claiming. Anyway, this repository has nothing to do with Kungfu.

** Usage

You can use ports other than 79, but the clients (e.g. Lynx) may not accept it. On some systems they forbid anyone who isn't root to open a port with port number lower than 1024; you might need to use =sudo= or =doas=.
